### Hi there 👋


🔭 I've advanced experience in development in JavaScript ecosystem (Node, React, ...) and PHP since 2017/2015.

💼 I'm currently working full time at Sayaris as a fullstask developer on PHP (Laravel) & VueJS...

↩️ I recently collaborated with EXPATEO on the following projects:
 - Migrate their PHP API to Node JS ([Hapi JS](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) / [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) / [Docker](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize))
 - Master the database model
 - Develop web-services in Node Js
 - Setup and maintain automated testing and deployment processes
 - Give the most reliable estimates possible of completion time
 - Document achievements and share knowledge with the teams

🤔 Now I've been researching web streaming, coming ...
